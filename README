I've updated the 'tcp_t_probe' Linux kernel module to probe TCP packets and print things like contention window size, slow start threshold, etc. at the transmitting side. I did that because I was researching whether I could predict the contention control states on the receiving side using e.g. Hidden Markov Model (HMM). To check the accuracy of my predictions, I needed the actual contention window size, slow start threshold, etc.

To use the kernel module, you better make sure your Linux kernel version is 4.13.0-36 and install Linux headers on your host Linux. 

Go to the src directory and run "make" to compile the kernel module. It should generate "tcp_t_probe.ko" file.

In the same directory;

Install the kernel module
$ sudo su
$ insmod tcp_t_probe.ko port=5001
$ exit
$ sudo chmod 444 /proc/net/tcpprobe

Start the IPERF server
$ iperf -s &

Record the output of tcptprobe kernel module
$ cat /proc/net/tcptprobe > /tmp/tcpprobe.out &
$ TCPCAP=$!  

Add some random loss to the ethernet interface
$sudo tc qdisc add dev enp0s3 root netem loss 10%

Keep watching what's being written into /tmp/tcpprobe.out
$tail -f /tmp/tcpprobe.out

Generate some TCP traffic
$ iperf -i 10 -t 1000 -c 10.0.2.15
